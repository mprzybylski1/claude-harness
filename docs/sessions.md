## Current Phase & Status

*(Rewritten each session)*

**Phase 2 (Active):** Harness hardening and telemetry — fixing workspace session-start gaps, telemetry reliability, and tool correctness issues surfaced in first real workspace run.

Phase 1 gate: complete (S6 2026-05-25)
- [x] Workspace model designed and implemented (T001–T009)
- [x] All Opus review findings fixed
- [x] First real workspace created and used for a live session (Scrabble Score)

## Active Work

**S15 — closed T072 (workspace git staging regression) + T050 (opus archive tests) + impl-review fixes.**

Files changed:
- `scripts/tools/close_ticket.py` — T072: added `_git_root_for(path)` using `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to detect correct git repo for workspace tickets; `dest.relative_to(ROOT)` fallback to absolute path; impl-review: `_git_root_for` returns `None` on failure (not ROOT), broadened except to OSError/SubprocessError
- `tests/test_workspace_path_flags.py` — T072: new `test_external_docs_path_workspace_stages_in_project_repo`; impl-review: new `test_non_git_workspace_warns_and_exits_nonzero`; tightened assertion to `"archive/T999"`
- `tests/test_rotate_opus_notes.py` — T050: new file with 8 tests covering decade routing, cross-decade split, append semantics, single-section no-op, and expand_carry_forward multi-file glob

Tickets opened: T073 (Opus post-session: bundle 3 log_tool_usage.py carry-forwards — race, >=, expanduser — medium)
Tickets closed: T072, T050

Remaining open: T073
